# Hybrid RSA-AES Secure Data Transmission

This project is a simple implementation of a Hybrid RSAâ€“AES Secure Data Transmission system.

## Architecture

- **client/**: A Node.js client that sends encrypted requests.
- **bff/**: A Node.js Express server that acts as a proxy.
- **integration-service/**: A Node.js Express server that handles the encryption and decryption of data.
